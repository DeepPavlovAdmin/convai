The organizers of ConvAI are not responsible for dialogs contents. It you have spotted a serious issue, please contact organizers about it by email [info@convai.io](info@convai.io).
10. After you were connected with your peer you will receive a starting message - a passage or two from a Wikipedia article.
11. Your task is to discuss the content of a presented passage with the peer and score her/his replies.
12. Please score every utterance of your peer with a ‘thumb UP’ button if you like it, and ‘thumb DOWN’ button in the opposite case.
13. To finish the conversation type or choose a command `/end`.
14. When the conversation is finished, you will receive a request from __@ConvaiBot__ to score the overall quality of the dialog along three dimensions:
- quality - how much are you satisfied with the whole conversation?
- breadth - in your opinion was a topic discussed thoroughly or just from one side?
- engagement - was it interesting to participate in this conversation?
15. If your peer ends the dialog before you, you will also receive a scoring request from __@ConvaiBot__.
16. Your conversations with a peer will be recorded for further use. By starting a chat you give permission to record your conversation and to release your anonymised conversation data publicly under [Apache License Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
